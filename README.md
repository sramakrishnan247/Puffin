# Sentece-Similarity
EE 526 Deep Learning Final Project

### Core Notebook
BERTPlay_Core.ipynb - This notebook contains our experiments on different BERT and NLP models for the Semantic similarity task.

### Game 1
SemanticSimilarityGame.ipynb<br>
This notebook contains an interactive game where a user needs to enter a sentence that is semantically similar to the provided sentence. A pretrained BERT-based model is used to evaluate the user's performance. 


### Game 2
ReadingComprehensionGame.ipynb <br>
This notebook contains an interactive game where a user needs to answer questions based on the given reading comprehension. A pretrained BERT-based model is used to evaluate the user's performance.
